# Build Instructions

You must be running a 64-bit x86 Linux distribution. Darling cannot be used on a 32-bit x86 system, not even to run 32-bit applications.

# Dependencies

Clang is required to compile Darling; at least Clang 6 is required. You can force a specific version of Clang (if it is installed on your system) by editing `Toolchain.cmake`.

A minimum of 4 GB of RAM is also required for building. Using swap space may help reduce the memory usage, but is likely to slow the build down significantly.

Linux 5.3 or higher is required.

**OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**

  You will need to build Darling with only the 64bit components. See **Build Options** for instructions. 

  ```
  $ sudo zypper install make cmake-full clang10 bison flex python-base glibc fuse-devel libsystemd0 \
  libelf1 cairo-devel libfreetype6 libjpeg-turbo libfontconfig1 libglvnd Mesa-libGL-devel \

  openssl llvm libcap-progs libtiff-devel libjpeg8-devel libXrandr-devel dbus-1-devel glu-devel ffmpeg-4-libswresample-devel
  ```

**Alpine Linux**

  Make sure to [enable the community repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Enable_Community_Repository).
  Alpine also doesn't support 32-bit builds, so make sure to [disable that](#disabling-32-bit-libraries).

  ```sh
  $ sudo apk add cmake clang bison flex xz fuse-dev pkgconfig libcap git git-lfs python2 python3 glu-dev \
  cairo-dev mesa-dev tiff-dev freetype-dev libxml2-dev fontconfig-dev libbsd-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev \
  giflib-dev pulseaudio-dev ffmpeg-dev dbus-dev libxkbfile-dev openssl-dev libexecinfo-dev make gcc g++ xdg-user-dirs
  ```

  These are the minimum requirements for building and running Darling on Alpine. Of course, if you want to run GUI applications,
  you'll also need a desktop environment.

# Fetch the Sources

Darling uses git-lfs. Set this up if needed with [official instructions](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).

Darling makes extensive use of Git submodules, therefore you cannot use a plain `git clone`. Make a clone like this:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/darlinghq/darling.git
```

**Attention:** The source tree requires up to 5 GB of disk space!

# Updating sources

If you have already cloned Darling and would like to get the latest changes, do this in the source root:

```
$ git lfs install
$ git pull
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

# Build

The build system of Darling is CMake. Makefiles are generated by CMake by default.

**Attention:** The build may require up to 16 GB of disk space! The Darling installation itself then takes up to 1 GB.

## Building and Installing

Now let's build Darling:

```
# Move into the cloned sources
$ cd darling

# Make a build directory
$ mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the build
$ cmake ..

# Build and install Darling
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

##  Build Options 

### Doing non-full (a.k.a. shallow) builds

You will notice that it takes a long time to build Darling. Darling contains the software layer equivalent to an entire operating system, which means it contains a large amount of code. You can optionally disable some large and less vital parts of the build in order to get faster builds.

To do this, use the `-DFULL_BUILD=OFF` option when configuring Darling through CMake.

You may encounter some things to be missing, such as JavaScriptCore. Before creating an issue about a certain library or framework missing from Darling, verify that you are doing a full build by not using this option or setting it to `ON`.

### Disabling 32-bit Libraries

Darling normally builds both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of all libraries, to enable 32-bit programs to run under Darling.
However, this means Darling also requires 32-bit version of certain native libraries. If you can't setup a multilib environment or you just
want to build only the 64-bit components, use `-DTARGET_i386=OFF` during configuration to disable building the 32-bit components.

### Parallel Builds

Another way to speed up the build is to run `make` with multiple jobs. For this, run `make -j8` instead, where 8 is a number of current jobs to run of your choosing. In general, avoid running more jobs than twice the amount CPU cores of your machine.

### "Unified" JavaScriptCore Builds

If you still want to build JavaScriptCore and have a bit of RAM to spare, JavaScriptCore also supports a build mode known as ["unified builds"](https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2018/02/17/on-compiling-webkit-now-twice-as-fast/). This build mode can cut JSC build times in half, at the expense of causing slightly higher RAM usage. This build mode can be enabled in Darling by adding `-DJSC_UNIFIED_BUILD=ON` when configuring the build.

### Debug Builds

By default, CMake setups up a non-debug, non-release build.
If you run LLDB and encounter messages indicating a lack of debug symbols, make sure you are doing a debug build. To do this, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

### Unit tests

Darling has a limited number of unit tests. These are not currently built by default, but this can be enabled with '-DENABLE_TESTS=1'.
These tests are then installed to /usr/libexec within your Darling container.

### Additional, Non-standard Binaries

Darling tries to stick to a standard macOS installation as much as possible. However, if you would like to build and install some additional packages (such as GNU tar), you can add `-DADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=ON`.

### Custom Installation Prefix

To install Darling in a custom directory use the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` CMake option. However, a Darling installataion is **NOT** portable, because the installataion prefix is hardcoded into the ``darling`` executable. This is intentional. If you do move your Darling installation you will get this error message:
```
Cannot mount overlay: No such file or directory
Cannot open mnt namespace file: No such file or directory
```
If you wish to properly move your Darling installation, the only supported option is for you to uninstall your current Darling installation, and then rebuild Darling with a different installation prefix.

## Known Issues

### BackBox


If your distribution is Backbox and you run into build issues try the following commands:

```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-6.0 600
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-6.0 600
```

### SELinux

On SELinux you may see the following error when starting Darling:

```
Cannot open mnt namespace file: No such file or directory
```

To work around this try this command: `setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1`.

### File System Support

Darling uses overlayfs for implementing prefixes on top of the macOS-like root filesystem. While overlayfs is not very picky about the lower (read-only) filesystem (where your `/usr` lives), it has stricter requirements for the upper filesystem (your home directory, unless you override the `DPREFIX` environment variable).

To quote the [kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt):

> The lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and does not need to be writable. The lower filesystem can even be another overlayfs. The upper filesystem will normally be writable and if it is it must support the creation of trusted.* extended attributes, and must provide valid d_type in readdir responses, so NFS is not suitable.

In addition to NFS not being supported, ZFS and eCryptfs encrypted storage are also known not to work.

If you try to use an unsupported file system, this error will be printed:

```
Cannot mount overlay: Invalid argument
```
