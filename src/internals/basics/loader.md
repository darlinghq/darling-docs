# Loader

Multiple loaders are involved in loading macOS applications on Linux. This is
due to the fact that macOS applications use
[Mach-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O) as the file format of
applications, dynamic libraries and so on, whereas Linux uses the
[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) format.

## mldr

[mldr](https://github.com/darlinghq/darling/blob/master/src/startup/mldr.c) is
the first loader. It's an ordinary Linux executable written in C. Its main
purpose is to map the Mach-O executable to be started into the memory, find out
what dynamic linker is required to fully load it (''/usr/lib/dyld'' is used on
macOS exclusively), load the respective dynamic linker and hand control over to
it.

mldr's secondary responsibility is to provide a gateway to the Linux and ELF
world. This involves aiding in [thread management](../threading/thread-implementation.md)
or loading required native libraries.

### 32 in 64

As an experimental technology, `mldr` is now executing 32-bit macOS applications
in 64-bit Linux processes. This is not such a daunting task as it may seem (some
general ideas are laid out in [this blog article](http://blog.dolezel.info/2017/02/running-32-bit-code-in-64-bit-linux.html)).

This approach has a few advantages. It eliminates the need for having all of
Darling's dependencies also in a 32-bit version. This becomes especially
pronounced when building Darling on Debian-based systems:

*  Darling builds 64-bit and 32-bit code in one go (so that it can produce fat Mach-O binaries).
*  On Debian, you need separate `-dev` packages for 64-bit and 32-bit build.
*  These packages cannot be installed at the same time (they conflict).

There are other benefits as well. For instance, it enables us to map the
[commpage](../macos-specifics/commpage.md) at the address where it exists on
macOS in 32-bit processes, which would not be possible in 32-bit Linux
processes, where the commpage address belongs in the kernel-only memory range
(upper 1 GB). This problem is non-existent in 64-bit Linux processes.

There are disadvantages as well. Interfacing with native Linux libraries
requires some degree of translation to be performed.

## dyld

Dyld is Apple's dynamic linker. It examines what libraries are needed by the
macOS application, loads them and performs other necessary tasks. After it is
done, it jumps to application's entry point.

Dyld is special in the sense that it as the only "executable" on macOS, it does
not (cannot) link to any libraries. As a consequence of this, it has to be
statically linked to a subset of libSystem (counterpart of glibc on Linux).
