# Debugging

We provide a [build of
LLDB](https://osdn.net/projects/darling/storage/apps/lldb.tar.bz2) that is known
to work under Darling. It is built from vanilla sources, i.e. without any
modifications.

That doesn't mean it works *reliably*. Fully supporting a debugger is a complex
task, so LLDB is known to be buggy under Darling.

## Troubleshooting LLDB

If you want to troubleshoot a problem with how LLDB runs under Darling, you need
to make `debugserver` produce a log file.

If running `debugserver` separately, add `-l targetfile`. If using LLDB directly
(which spawns `debugserver` as a subprocess automatically), pass an additional
environment variable to LLDB:

```
LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_LOG_FILE=somelogfile.txt
```

## External `DebugServer`

If you're having trouble using LLDB normally, you may get luckier by running the
`debugserver` separately.

In one terminal, start the `debugserver`:

```
$ ./debugserver 127.0.0.1:12345 /bin/bash
```

In another terminal, connect to the server in LLDB:

```	
$ ./lldb
(lldb) platform select remote-macosx
Platform: remote-macosx
Connected: no
(lldb) process connect connect://127.0.0.1:12345
```

Please note that environment variables may be missing by default, if used like this.

## How it works

Debugging support in Darling makes use of what we call "cooperative debugging".
It means the code in the debuggee is aware it's being debugged and actively
assists the process. In Darling, this role is taken on mainly by
[sigexc.c](https://github.com/darlinghq/darling/blob/master/src/kernel/emulation/linux/signal/sigexc.c)
in `libsystem_kernel.dylib`, so no application modifications are necessary.

MacOS debuggers use a combination of BSD-like and Mach APIs to control and
inspect the debuggee.

To emulate the macOS behavior, Darling makes use of POSIX real-time signals to
invoke actions in the cooperative debugging code.

| Operation | macOS | Linux | Darling implementation |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Attach to debuggee | `ptrace(PT_ATTACHEXC)` <br> Causes the kernel to redirect all signals (aka exceptions) to the Mach "exception port" of the process. Only debuggee termination is notified via `wait()`. | `ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH)` <br> Signals sent to the debuggee and the debuggee termination event are received in the debugger via `wait()`. | Notify the LKM that we will be tracing the process. Send a RT signal to the debuggee to notify it of the situation. The debuggee sets up handlers to handle all signals and forward them to the exception port. |
| Examine registers | `thread_get_state(X86_THREAD_STATE)` | `ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS)` | Upon receiving a signal, the debuggee reads its own register state and passes it to the kernel via `thread_set_state()`. |
| Pausing the debuggee | `kill(SIGSTOP)` | `kill(SIGSTOP)` or `ptrace(PTRACE_INTERRUPT)` | Send a RT signal to the debuggee that it should act as if `SIGSTOP` were sent to the process. We cannot send a real `SIGSTOP`, because then the debuggee couldn't provide/update register state to the debugger etc. |
| Change signal delivery | `ptrace(PT_THUPDATE)` | `ptrace(PTRACE_rest)` | Send a RT signal to the debuggee to inform it what it should do with the signal (ignore, pass it to the application etc.) |
| Set memory watchpoints | `thread_set_state(X86_DEBUG_STATE)` | `ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER)` | Implement the effects of `PTRACE_POKEUSER` in the LKM. |

## Built-in debugging utilities

### malloc

**libmalloc** (the default library that implements `malloc()`, `free()` and
friends) supports many debug features that can be turned on via environment,
among them:

* `MallocScribble` (fill freed memory with `0x55`)
* `MallocPreScribble` (fill allocated memory with `0xaa`)
* `MallocGuardEdges` (guard edges of large allocations)

When this is not enough, you can use **libgmalloc**, which is (for the most
part) a drop-in replacement for libmalloc. This is how you use it:

```
$ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 ./test`
```

libgmalloc catches memory issues such as use-after-free and buffer overflows,
and attempts to do this the moment they occur, rather than wait for them to mess
up some internal state and manifest elsewhere. It does that by placing each
allocation on its own memory page(s), and adding a guard page next to it (like
`MallocGuardEdges` on steroids) â€” by default, after the allocated buffer (to
catch buffer overruns), or with `MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE`, before it (to catch
buffer underruns). You're likely want to try it both ways, with and without
`MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE`. Another useful option is `MALLOC_FILL_SPACE` (similar
to `MallocPreScribble` from above). See
[libgmalloc(3)](https://www.manpagez.com/man/3/libgmalloc/) for more details.

### Objective-C and Cocoa

In Objective-C land, you can set `NSZombieEnabled=YES` in order to detect
use-after-free of Objective-C objects. This replaces `-[NSObject dealloc]` with
a different implementation that does not deallocate the memory, but instead
turns the object into a "zombie". Upon receiving any message (which indicates a
use-after-free), the zombie will log the message and abort the process.

Another useful option is `NSObjCMessageLoggingEnabled=YES`, which will instruct
the Objective-C runtime to log all the sent messages to a file in `/tmp`.

In AppKit, you can set the `NSShowAllViews` default (e.g. with `-NSShowAllViews
1` on the command line) to cause it to draw a colorful border around each view.

### xtrace

You can use **xtrace** to trace Darwin syscalls a program makes, a lot like
using `strace on Linux:

```
$ xtrace vm_stat
[139] fstat64(1, 0x7fffffdfe340) -> 0
[139] host_self_trap() -> port right 2563
[139] mach_msg_trap(0x7fffffdfdfc0, MACH_SEND_MSG|MACH_RCV_MSG, 40, 1072, port 1543, 0, port 0)
[139]         {remote = copy send 2563, local = make send-once 1543, id = 219}, 16 bytes of inline data
[139]         mach_host::host_statistics64(copy send 2563, 4, 38)
[139]     mach_msg_trap() -> KERN_SUCCESS
[139]         {local = move send-once 1543, id = 319}, 168 bytes of inline data
[139]         mach_host::host_statistics64() -> [75212, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1024, 4159955152, 720014745, 503911965, 0, 4160737656, 2563, 4292863152, 4160733284, 4160733071, 0], 38 
[139] write_nocancel(1, 0x7fd456800600, 58)Mach Virtual Memory Statistics: (page size of 4096 bytes)
-> 58
[139] write_nocancel(1, 0x7fd456800600, 49)Pages free:                               75212.
-> 49
...
```

`xtrace` can trace both BSD syscalls and Mach traps. For `mach_msg()` in
particular, `xtrace` additionally displays the message being sent or received,
as well as tries to decode it as a MIG routine call or reply.

Note that `xtrace` only traces emulated Darwin syscalls, so any native Linux
syscalls made (usually by native ELF libraries) will not be displayed, which
means information and open file descriptors may appear to come from nowhere in
those cases.
